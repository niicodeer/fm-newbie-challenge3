## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Hover states

### What I learned
With this challenge I practice the hover states to make the elements a little interactive, just using CSS in this case. Also practice the "z-index" property to hide the icon on the header image and display it when the mouse hover it. (Honestly, it took me a little while to figure it out, 'cuz the icon doesnÂ´t appeared when the mouse was hovering until i aplied the z-index:0 in the icon class (i mean before "the efect")).
